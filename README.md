# ðŸ“– Introduction
The EasyTech Bookstore Inventory Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to streamline and automate bookstore operations. Built with JavaFX for a modern and interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) and powered by socket programming for multi-client connectivity, the system enables multiple users to interact with a central server seamlessly.

It integrates with a MySQL database for persistent data storage and retrieval, ensuring that all inventory, sales, and customer records are securely maintained.

With this system, bookstore owners can efficiently:

Add, edit, and manage inventory items

Record and track sales transactions

Accept payments via mobile banking or card

Register and handle customer complaints

The EasyTech Bookstore Inventory Management System empowers bookstore owners by simplifying day-to-day operations, enhancing transaction accuracy, and providing a smooth user experience for both staff and customers.

Traditional bookstore operations often rely on manual processes which are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time insights into sales or inventory levels. These limitations inspired the development of a software-based solution that can:
Automate inventory and sales tracking.


Handle real-time multi-client communication.


Integrate payment systems like BKASH, NAGAD, and Card payments.


Maintain proper transaction logs and generate digital receipts.


Provide a professional dashboard for easy access and operation.


This project was also motivated by the opportunity to apply advanced object-oriented programming concepts such as multithreading, socket communication, JavaFX UI development, and MySQL integration.
